/**
 * Validates the sleep/consolidation derivation step: can the LLM
 * correctly infer personality dimensions from formation memories alone?
 *
 * Each test feeds formation memories through a "sleep" derivation prompt
 * and judges whether the output captures a specific dimension. Tests both
 * HC (Cluster B) and PP (healthy) to verify differentiation.
 *
 * These tests are permanent — they validate the memory → inference chain
 * that underpins the entire personality emergence architecture.
